# Welcome to AngularJS on CloudBees

This is a CloudBees "ClickStart" project for AngularJS "express-seed" project. Forked from <a href="https://github.com/CloudBees-community/angular-js-clickstart">angular-js-clickstart</a>

Run it here.

This will setup a continuous deployment pipeline. App is deployed served up from a tiny node.js server (you 
can then clone and mess with it, or change the backend to what you need).
